# SnowdramaGodotTools
A package of tools I use in Godot!

These are all made for 4.2+ Some things wont work in older versions

I also believe they need C# 7+ but could be wrong, haven't really done thorough testing haha

Not all of them are working or are even finished(Delaunay Triangulation for example)
